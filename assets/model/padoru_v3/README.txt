PADORU v3.1

Padoru 3D model originally made for VRChat, modelled in Blender

For v3.0 I've tweaked the model to improve the lipsync and for use with VRChat's Avatars 3.0. The new model is not compatible with Padoru v2.0. If you want to upgrade, I'd recommend creating a new project.


FEATURES
● Padoru with lipsync and expressions
● 14.6k tris, 1 material

  - Silent's Cel Shading Shader (recommended) - https://s-ilent.booth.pm/items/1894974

INSTRUCTIONS
● The 'Padoru_TexShadow' texture is an optional shadow tone map, designed to be used with Silent's Cel Shading Shader
● The 'UV Layout' is a guide for how the mesh is laid out, to make re-texturing easier
